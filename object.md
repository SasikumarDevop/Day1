OBJECT

=> Objects are important data types in javascript
=> Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.)
=>  Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.
=> Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
=>  These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
=> Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
=> An object, is a reference data type.
=> That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.



OBECT AND PROPERTIES

=> A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object
=> Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects

        objectName.propertyName

INTERNAL REPRESENATAION OF OBJECTS

=> Internally, JavaScript engines use various data structures to represent objects efficiently.
=> One common approach is using a hash table or a similar structure to store the object’s properties and their corresponding values
